WGU C196 Student Course Tracker Application

An app for WGU students to track their term progress. Allows students to add and remove terms 
and courses, change course statuses, add assessments to courses, and keep notes on both courses 
and assessments. Supports Android versions 8.0+.

The database uses the Room Database structure. This is a much more user friendly option.

Alerts/notifications are able to be set for the Courses and Assessments as required. 
Terms were left out as this was not a requirement at the time of submission. 
Its easy enough to add if you like, just follow the code for the other two.
(You can initiate the alerts by clicking on the bell icons on the corresponding screens!)

To start the application:

Open Android Studio and select Open Existing Android Studio Project
